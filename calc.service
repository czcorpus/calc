# NOTE:  When the service fails to start, this is what happens: there will be
# automatic restart attempts every RestartSec seconds, until systemd notices
# *strictly more* than StartLimitBurst attempts have occurred within
# StartLimitInterval, at which point restart attempts cease.
#
# For the default values of StartLimitInterval=10s, StartLimitBurst=3 and
# RestartSec=3, this means the following happens on failure:
#
#                                                    |
#             time: 0s ---- 3s ---- 6s ---- 9s - 10s |------------------>
# restart attempts: ^ 1st   ^ 2nd   ^ 3rd   ^ 4th    |
#
# After the 4th attempt, more than 3 restart attempts have been made in the last
# 10s, so at this point systemd stops trying. This is generally reasonable
# because this probably means that there's a persistent problem which must be
# resolved manually. Also, if you have failure notifications enabled (cf.
# OnFailure above), the sysadmin's inbox won't be flooded with the same failure
# notification over and over.
#
# Notice that this mechanism depends on mutually compatible settings of
# StartLimitInterval, StartLimitBurst and RestartSec. E.g. if you decrease
# StartLimitInterval to 5s and leave the other parameters unchanged, then there
# will never be more than 3 restart attempts within StartLimitInterval, and
# systemd will keep trying to restart the service indefinitely.
